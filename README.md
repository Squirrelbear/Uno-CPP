# Uno-CPP

A C++ version of Uno based on my other Java project. See the Java version of the project for full details about the constraints and features. This project is a replication to convert the Java with drawing on JPanels to using SFML to draw onto the SFML window.

Java version YouTube Demo: ([Youtube Demo](https://youtu.be/6feJMIqSF98))

Requires the following to compile:
* SFML 2.5.1 (may work with other versions, but 2.5.1 was used for testing): https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
* C++17 by adding: /std:c++17
